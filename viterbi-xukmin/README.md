This folder contains the the class that implements both a Convolutional Encoder and a Viterbi Decoder.
The Origonal code was written by Min Xu which can be found at https://github.com/xukmin/viterbi .

Jonti modified it a little to allow for continuous encoding and decoding for use with Qt.
Because of the requirement for Qt, viterbi_main.cpp, viterbi_test.cpp and Makefile were removed.
